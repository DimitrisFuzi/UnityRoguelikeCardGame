# Card Battler ‚Äì Unity Learning Clone (Inspired by Slay the Spire)

A prototype built in **Unity (C#)** to practice roguelike deck-builder mechanics.  
This project was developed purely as a **learning exercise** and is not intended as a commercial release.

## üéÆ Overview
This prototype replicates core elements of *Slay the Spire* to help me learn:
- Unity architecture & scripting in C#
- Turn-based combat systems
- Card mechanics and UI interactions
- Modular design principles with managers & interfaces
